                    <h3>Where I was born</h3>
					<p>I was born in 1995 in Moscow, Russia. However, I didn't live in Russia my whole life. When I was a mere 9 months old my parents decided to move to America because the Soviet Union fell apart and they wanted to give a life to my brother and me. </p>

					<h3>Life In America</h3>
					<p>Well, we moved to a city called Homestead when I was little with my family consisting of my Brother,Parents,Grandparents,Uncle and, Aunt. At first life was hard for my family, Even though my parents both had master degrees my father had to work as a taxi driver to support our family. As time went by we created our own business that is still thriving today. However, that is later on. </p>

					<h3>School Life</h3>
					<p>When I was 6 years old I started school at hollywood elementary school. I remember this time vividly as we would start traveling a lot. We would go to key west and disney world frequently. Honestly it was a lot of fun. However, when I was 10 years old my family decided to take to to Russia to learn Russian at a private school. I ended up staying in Russia for about 2 years. I did successfully learn russian albeit I do have a slight accent. When I was 13 we moved to Texas, Huffman to be exact we stayed there for 3 years due to complications with my moms health. In the end, we just decided all together to go back to Florida because we loved it. We moved to a small town called Englewood- my last location. I stayed here for pretty much the rest of my life with the temporary house in Miami for FIU</p>

					<h4>Hobbies</h3>
					<p>Honestly, this is one kind of funny because I have a lot of hobbies. My favorites are Gaming,Fishing and Hockey though. I hold fishing and hockey very dear to me because my Dad is the only parent left alive and I like to spend time with him when I can. Fishing by far with him is one of my favorite hobbies as we go to Boca Pass and just relax and spend time together its very nice. With Hockey we play almost every day when Im in Englewood as we have our own nets and hockey sticks. My dad plays it recreationally at a ice rink but I'm not that good on skates. Anyways I just like to spend time when I can with family, because you never know how much time you have left with them.</p>
